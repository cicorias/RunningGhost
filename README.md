# Running Ghost on Ubuntu #
There are a variety of ways for running ghost as a daemon, etc. But, I wanted to get working stuff  for me :)

Thanks to [kvc.io](http://kvz.io/blog/2009/12/15/run-nodejs-as-a-service-on-ubuntu-karmic/) for the background.


## Ghost ##
Download and install instructions are [here](http://support.ghost.org/installing-ghost-linux/).


## Running site ##
At some point i'll migrate all my old blog posts and content. That's a huge effort as I was using Community Server from a decade ago for years.

But, here's the running blog on an Azure Linux Ubuntu instance.
